circuito.io
===========

* Circuito.io is a system for generating a circuit schematic & accompanying code samples.
Circuito.io generate the schematic & code based on your selection of micro-controller, i/o and power devices.

* For more information, see the website at: http://circuito.io

How to read this repository
---------------------------
You are here because you ised circuito.io and asked for a circuit and code sample for your project.
This is your project folder, you'll find here:
* bom.txt - all the parts used in designing the circuit - your chosen parts & any additionals that may be required for the circuit to work.
* firmware folder - includes all code need to operate the i/o devices using the micro-controller. firmware.ino is the main logic file.
* PCB folder - where you'll find the schematic diagram and breadboards view as a Fritzing file, and as two png files.
